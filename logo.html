      <h2>ancient scales </h2> - to rep fairness and the free market
      <br />
      <h2>flame</h2> - to rep the spark of industry and electricisity
      <br />
      <h2>the wheel</h2> - to rep transfer from one place to another -
      the wheel is a tech that is still used today but was used in ancient times
      as well <br />
      <h2>water pot vessel</h2> - to rep a focus on quality of service
      to people externally and internally and also humility. By having the cup
      at the highest place of honour those who serve and those whom are served
      are equality valued. Employees are as important to the business as
      customers. Equal amount of value and respect judged case by case rather
      than assuming one party is more worthy than the other. <br />
